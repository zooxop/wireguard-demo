# TunnelKit

This library provides a generic framework for VPN development on Apple platforms.

## OpenVPN

TunnelKit comes with a simplified Swift/Obj-C implementation of the [OpenVPN®][dep-openvpn] protocol, whose crypto layer is built on top of [OpenSSL 1.1.1][dep-openssl].

The client is known to work with OpenVPN® 2.3+ servers.

- [x] Handshake and tunneling over UDP or TCP
- [x] Ciphers
    - AES-CBC (128/192/256 bit)
    - AES-GCM (128/192/256 bit, 2.4)
- [x] HMAC digests
    - SHA-1
    - SHA-2 (224/256/384/512 bit)
- [x] NCP (Negotiable Crypto Parameters, 2.4)
    - Server-side
- [x] TLS handshake
    - Server validation (CA, EKU)
    - Client certificate
- [x] TLS wrapping
    - Authentication (`--tls-auth`)
    - Encryption (`--tls-crypt`)
- [x] Compression framing
    - Via `--comp-lzo` (deprecated in 2.4)
    - Via `--compress`
- [x] Compression algorithms
    - LZO (via `--comp-lzo` or `--compress lzo`)
- [x] Key renegotiation
- [x] Replay protection (hardcoded window)

The library therefore supports compression framing, just not newer compression. Remember to match server-side compression and framing, otherwise the client will shut down with an error. E.g. if server has `comp-lzo no`, client must use `compressionFraming = .compLZO`.

### Support for .ovpn configuration

TunnelKit can parse .ovpn configuration files. Below are a few details worth mentioning.

#### Non-standard

- Single-byte XOR masking
    - Via `--scramble xormask <character>`
    - XOR all incoming and outgoing bytes by the ASCII value of the character argument
    - See [Tunnelblick website][about-tunnelblick-xor] for more details

#### Unsupported

- UDP fragmentation, i.e. `--fragment`
- Compression via `--compress` other than empty or `lzo`
- Connecting via proxy
- External file references (inline `<block>` only)
- Static key encryption (non-TLS)
- `<connection>` blocks
- `vpn_gateway` and `net_gateway` literals in routes

#### Ignored

- Some MTU overrides
    - `--link-mtu` and variants
    - `--mssfix`
- Multiple `--remote` with different `host` values (first wins)
- Static client-side routes

Many other flags are ignored too but it's normally not an issue.

## WireGuard

TunnelKit offers a user-friendly API to the modern [WireGuard®][dep-wireguard] protocol.

### Manual Xcode steps

If you add any `TunnelKitWireGuard*` Swift package to the "Link with binary libraries" section of your app or tunnel extension, you are bound to hit this error:

```
ld: library not found for -lwg-go
```

because part of the WireGuardKit package is based on `make`, which SwiftPM doesn't support yet.

Therefore, make sure to follow the steps below for proper integration:

- Copy `Scripts/build_wireguard_go_bridge.sh` somewhere in your project.
- In Xcode, click File -> New -> Target. Switch to "Other" tab and choose "External Build System".
- Type a name for your target.
- Open the "Info" tab and replace `/usr/bin/make` with `$(PROJECT_DIR)/path/to/build_wireguard_go_bridge.sh` in "Build Tool".
- Switch to "Build Settings" and find SDKROOT. Type in `macosx` if you target macOS, or type in `iphoneos` if you target iOS.
- Locate your tunnel extension target and switch to "Build Phases" tab.
- Locate "Dependencies" section and hit "+" to add the target you have just created.
- Repeat the process for each platform.

## Installation

### Requirements

- iOS 13.0+ / macOS 10.15+
- SwiftPM 5.3
- Git (preinstalled with Xcode Command Line Tools)
- golang (for WireGuardKit)

It's highly recommended to use the Git package provided by [Homebrew][dep-brew].

### Caveats

Make sure to set "Enable Bitcode" (iOS) to NO, otherwise the library [would not be able to link OpenSSL][about-pr-bitcode] (OpenVPN) and the `wg-go` bridge (WireGuard).

Recent versions of Xcode (latest is 13.1) have an issue where the "Frameworks" directory is replicated inside application extensions. This is not a blocker during development, but will prevent your archive from being validated against App Store Connect due to the following error:

    ERROR ITMS-90206: "Invalid Bundle. The bundle at '*.appex' contains disallowed file 'Frameworks'."

You will need to add a "Run Script" phase to your main app target where you manually remove the offending folder, i.e.:

    rm -rf "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${PLUGINS_FOLDER_PATH}/YourTunnelTarget.appex/Frameworks"

for iOS and:

    rm -rf "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${PLUGINS_FOLDER_PATH}/YourTunnelTarget.appex/Contents/Frameworks"

for macOS.

### Demo

Download the library codebase locally:

    $ git clone https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/tunnelkit.git

There are demo targets containing a simple app for testing the tunnels. Open `Demo/TunnelKit.xcodeproject` in Xcode and run it on both iOS and macOS.

For the VPN to work properly, the demo requires:

- _App Groups_ and _Keychain Sharing_ capabilities
- App IDs with _Packet Tunnel_ entitlements

both in the main app and the tunnel extension targets.

In order to test connectivity in your own environment, modify the file `Demo/Demo/Configuration.swift` to match your VPN server parameters.

Example:

    private let ca = CryptoContainer(pem: """
	-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
	MIIFJDCC...
	-----END CERTIFICATE-----
    """)

Make sure to also update the following constants in the `*ViewController.swift` files, according to your developer account and your target bundle identifiers:

    private let appGroup = "..."
    private let tunnelIdentifier = "..."

Remember that the App Group on macOS requires a team ID prefix.

## Documentation

The library is split into several modules, in order to decouple the low-level protocol implementation from the platform-specific bridging, namely the [NetworkExtension][ne-home] VPN framework.

Full documentation of the public interface is available and can be generated by opening the package in Xcode and running "Build Documentation" (Xcode 13).

### TunnelKit

This component includes convenient classes to control the VPN tunnel from your app without the NetworkExtension headaches. Have a look at `VPN` implementations:

- `MockVPN` (default, useful to test on simulator)
- `NetworkExtensionVPN` (anything based on NetworkExtension)
